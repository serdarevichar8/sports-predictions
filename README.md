# NFL-Predictions

* FootballModel.R

  This R script contains the loop we wrote to webscrape football reference for all our data. There is also a linear regression model generated in this file, as well as the webscrape to Draftkings.

* CSV Datasets

  All of these were generated similarly to how the loop in the first R script is written. I'm pretty sure I wrote a Python file to scrape the dataset, but I can't find it (I have poor file organization).

* Football Model.py

  This file contains the generation of the models we used to predict results. It utilizes the datasets we curated in the R script above. It similarly scrapes Draftkings to then run the generated models.
